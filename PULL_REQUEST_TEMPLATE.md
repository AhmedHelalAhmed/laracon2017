<!--

Important!

Please do not submit pull requests to this repository; they muddy up the structure I worked hard on to make the refactorings from the presentation easy to navigate.

GitHub only lets me close PRs, not delete them, so every new PR added is just noise that makes it harder to see the PRs I created to show the refactorings.

This isn't a real project and I won't merge any PRs under any circumstances, so please help me keep the PR list clean.
